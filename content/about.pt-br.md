ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @macmiranda, a high-achieving generalist with 16+ years of experience managing highly-available distributed systems with focus on security. In other words, a problem solver in the hyperconverged world.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in DevSecOps, ML, Python, Automation tools (yes, even Power Automate), Threat Research and Blockchain technologies.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and studying for the ComptTIA CySA+ and the CKS exams.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via https://linkedin.com/in/macmiranda/
